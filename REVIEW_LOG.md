# Review & revision log — city-similarity-map

Running log of reviewer findings and fixes. Newest phases at the bottom.

## Phase 0 — user feedback + attached novelty review (this round)

Editorial / content:
- [x] Novelty framing reworked: dropped "demonstration, not a discovery" and
      "faithful, transparent replication"; RELATED WORK rewritten as an actual
      literature review + modest, specific "what this adds".
- [x] Reproducibility paragraph: dropped seed prose and "it's all in the repo";
      kept tools + versions, added repo link.
- [x] Removed "a teaching demo by".
- [x] orthogonal Procrustes: added gloss + Schönemann (1966) reference + link.
- [x] Edge-count-vs-cutoff list → inline SVG chart.
- [x] Removed the self-describing "step-by-step build; token resolution; geo-fidelity" list.

Substantive (from the novelty review):
- [x] geo-fidelity CEILING computed: raw 300-d cosine distance vs great-circle
      Spearman rho = 0.503. ALL four 2-D layouts (.57-.67) exceed it — the
      reductions concentrate geography (denoising). Added to methodology + RELATED WORK.
- [x] Ranking robustness: t-SNE spans ~.63-.73 (perplexity/seed), UMAP ~.51-.67.
      Exact t-SNE/UMAP order is NOT stable — reframed as "neighbourhood >= linear >= raw".
- New refs: Konkol 2017 (already), Recchia & Louwerse 2014, Louwerse & Benesh 2012,
  Schönemann 1966 (Procrustes).

Layout:
- [ ] Desktop + mobile pass (user reports it opens badly on both).

## Phase 1+ — multi-agent reviewer loop (below)

## Round 1 (workflow wf_99f9cea5) — citations lens (only lens that completed)
- [x] MED: orphan ref Liétard 2021 — added in-text cite in Related-work LLM sentence.
- [x] MED: refs out of order (Kruskal before Konkol) — swapped so Ko < Kr.
- [x] LOW: McInnes cited two ways — JS UMAP note now 'McInnes et al., 2018' to match.
- [x] LOW: combined (Kruskal 1964; Borg & Groenen 2005) both linked #ref-kruskal — split anchors.
- facts/grammar/clarity/consistency lenses FAILED (stalls/API) — re-running lighter.
